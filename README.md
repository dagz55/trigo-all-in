# 🔥🗺️ Firebase Studio Next.js Starter 🚀

Welcome to this enhanced Next.js project, incubated within Firebase Studio! This isn't just a basic starter; it's a launchpad designed with a vision, potentially evolving into something like the **TriGo App** concept outlined in our project blueprint. We're mixing the power of Next.js and Firebase with the beautiful mapping capabilities of Mapbox!

This project provides a solid foundation using modern web technologies, ready for you to build upon.

## ✨ Features

Leveraging the integrated Mapbox GL JS, this starter is primed for features like:

*   **🗺️ Interactive Maps:** Built with [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/how-mapbox-empowers-micromobility-platforms-with-cutting-edge-sdks-and-apis) for dynamic and performant map experiences.
*   **📍 Turn-by-Turn Navigation:** Potential for implementing navigation using the [Mapbox Navigation SDK](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/webinar-recap-build-smarter-navigation-with-mapbox).
*   **⏱️ ETA & Real-time Tracking:** Foundation for calculating Estimated Times of Arrival and tracking trips live.
*   **👨‍💻 Admin Fleet Monitoring:** Concepts for dashboards allowing real-time fleet monitoring.

## 🎨 Style & Design

We believe in a clean and intuitive user experience. Our style guidelines aim for:

*   **Primary Color:** A calming blue (`#3498db`) for map backgrounds and thematic consistency.
*   **Secondary Color:** Crisp white (`#ffffff`) for text and UI elements, ensuring readability.
*   **Accent Color:** Vibrant green (`#2ecc71`) for route lines, calls to action, and interactive highlights.
*   **Layout:** Map-centric design, with UI elements thoughtfully placed to be non-intrusive.
*   **Icons:** Clear and recognizable icons for map markers and points of interest.
*   **Animations:** Smooth transitions for map panning, zooming, and route updates.

## 🚀 Getting Started
